**Introduction:**

Mental illness presents a substantial economic burden in low and lower-middle income countries (LMICs), both in direct costs to households and indirect costs in foregone productivity. A frequently cited estimate of the global economic burden of mental illness—US$ 16 trillion between 2010-30 (Bloom et al., 2011)—suggests that these losses to the global economy may be large (Patel et al., 2018). Approaches to deriving estimates of the global economic burden of mental illness, however, rely on limited data and numerous empirical assumptions about both the size of the disease burden and its impacts on productivity and direct costs. New estimates of the morbidity and mortality associated with mental illness have become available (Vigo et al., 2016; Walker et al., 2015), and recent studies point to large indirect costs to households associated with severe mental illness (Opoku-Boateng et al., 2017). The proposed study will review different approaches to estimating the global economic burden of mental illness from Bloom et al., 2011 and other sources, integrate new estimates and methods in estimating the burden, and reach estimates while incorporating parameter and structural uncertainty. 

**Aims:**

To re-evaluate the global economic burden of mental illness and generate estimates of direct costs to households and indirect costs in losses of productivity attributable to mental illness.

**Hypotheses:**

Prior estimates of the total economic burden of mental illness using human capital cost-of-illness analysis, macroeconomic analysis, and value-of-a-statistical-life approaches likely represent an underestimate of the total economic burden attributable to mental illness.

**Purpose:**

There is a paucity of research that seeks to quantify the economic burden of mental illness. The available evidence, however, suggests that mental illness can present a substantial economic burden on patients, households, and societies. Quantifying the estimated economic burden can help guide policymakers in prioritizing responses to mental illness and better characterize the financial aspects of the global mental health burden. 

**Data:**

Drawing on data from the World Development Indicators from the World Bank and the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) Global Burden of Disease data, the study will apply national aggregate data to calculate the total economic burden of mental illness using human capital cost-of-illness analysis, macroeconomic analysis, and value-of-a-statistical-life approaches. 

**Methodology:**

First, the study will draw on a literature review of the global costs of mental illness, in order to provide an overview of the existing literature, approaches to costing, and categories of costs that ought to be completed in a completing costing exercise. Second, the paper will gather and replicate different estimates of the global burden of disease attributable to mental illness, using IHME GBD data and the approaches by Vigo et al. and Walker et al. to account for morbidity and mortality attributable to mental health, but via other causes of death and disability (e.g., suicide, of which a proportion of attempts are due to mental health conditions). Then, the study will apply three costing approaches, described in Bloom et al., 2011, to estimate the direct and indirect costs attributable to mental illness. Finally, the paper will compare these estimates to previous costing exercises, conducting sensitivity analyses to assess the extent to which parameter and structural uncertainty may influence the conclusions.

Under the human capital cost-of-illness analysis, data on the prevalence of mental health disorders will be combined with economic costs—both direct and indirect—per patient with a given condition. Lost economic growth will be calculated by estimating the depletion of capital and labor and the expected impact on growth and output; prior studies have estimated the effect of mental illness on lost economic output indirectly, but estimating the average loss for somatic non-communicable diseases. If possible, and where data are available, the paper will attempt to estimate the depletion directly, but will present the indirect estimation approach either as a comparison or substitute, if data are not available. Finally, the value of a statistical life method will utilize a base estimate of VSL, drawing from global metanalyses, as well as country-specific VSLs, to render the morbidity and mortality attributable to mental illnesses into monetary terms.

**IRB considerations:**

The research—which draws exclusively on secondary country-level data reported at the national or sub-national level—does not involve data collection, experimentation, or investigation concerning human subjects. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health has determined that the study is not human subjects research, and that additional review is not required (protocol #: IRB20-1946, November 13, 2020).
