**Introduction:**

The global burden of mental disorders is considerable, both in its impacts on human health and the economic consequences mental disorders impose (Patel et al., 2018). A frequently cited study of the global economic burden of non-communicable diseases suggests that the economic losses to the global economy due to mental disorders may be large (Bloom et al., 2011): a value of statistical life (VSL) approach estimated the economic burden of mental disorders in 2010 at 8.5 trillion USD 2010 (approximately 10.2 trillion USD 2021). Since 2010, new studies estimating the morbidity and mortality associated with mental illness have since become available (Vigo et al., 2016; Walker et al., 2015). These studies suggest that current estimates of the global burden of mental illness may be considerably underestimated, which, in turn, has implications for estimating the true economic burden of mental illness. This study reviews and incorporates new estimates and approaches in quantifying the burden of mental illness and, using multiple VSL approaches, arrives at global and national estimates of the economic cost of mental disorders. 

**Aims:**

To re-evaluate the global burden of mental illness -- and the economic costs thereof -- at the global and national level.

**Hypotheses:**

The global burden of mental illness is underestimated in both morbidity and mortality. Consequently, prior estimates of the total economic burden of mental illness likely represent an underestimate of the total economic burden attributable to mental illness.

**Purpose:**

There is a paucity of research that seeks to quantify the global economic burden of mental illness. The available evidence, however, suggests that mental illness entails large direct costs (with respect to medical care) and indirect costs (due to forgone income and productivity), in addition to the intrinsic value of the loss of life and health due to illness. Quantifying the estimated economic burden can help guide policymakers in prioritizing responses to mental illness and better characterize the economic aspects of the global mental health burden. 

**Data:**

The study draws on two data source: the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) Global Burden of Disease data and data from the World Development Indicators from the World Bank.

**Methodology:**

First, the study will review and incorporate different estimates of the global burden of disease attributable to mental illness, using IHME GBD data and the approaches by Vigo et al. and Walker et al. to account for morbidity and mortality attributable to mental health. The study will then propose a composite measure to present a more accurate estimate of DALYs attributable to mental disorders and will attempt to justify the assumptions underpinning the composite approach. Finally, the paper will apply a value of statistical life approach to estimate the economic burden of mental illness using each of the different global estimates of the disease burden. The value of a statistical life method will use four values of a DALY to provide a range of estimates of the economic burden of morbidity and mortality attributable to mental illnesses.

**IRB considerations:**

The research—which draws exclusively on secondary country-level data reported at the national or sub-national level—does not involve data collection, experimentation, or investigation concerning human subjects. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health has determined that the study is not human subjects research, and that additional review is not required (protocol #: IRB20-1946, November 13, 2020).
